                          Commons BeanUtils Package
                            Version 1.8.0-BETA
                               Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:
============

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
BeanUtils package, and highlights changes since the previous version.

Compatibility with 1.7.0
========================
BeanUtils 1.8.0-BETA is binary compatible release with Beanutils 1.7.0,
containing a number of bug fixes and enhancements.

ENHANCEMENTS:
=============

Expression Resolver
-------------------
Prior versions of BeanUtils duplicated the logic required to "resolve"
expressions and suffered from inconsistency as a result. A new plugable Resolver
has been introduced in BeanUtils 1.8.0 which removes that duplication, makes
all expression resolution consistent and allows different expression syntax
flavours to be plugged in. As well as this BeanUtils now has improved support
for nested Map and indexed properties.

Conversion
----------
The converter implementations have been significantly improved in this release:

1) Arrays: A new "generic" ArrayConverter has been introduced which delegates
           the individual component conversion to an appropriate Converter for
           the component type.
2) Numbers: All numeric Converters now handle conversion between numeric types
           and have improved conversion facilities to and from Strings
           based on formats and/or a specified Locale.
3) Dates: Improvements to the existing SQL Date, Time and Timestamp converters
          now handle conversion between Date/Calendar types and have improved
          conversion facilities to and from Strings based on formats and/or
          a specified Locale. New java.util.Date and Calendar converter
          implementations have been added.

Prior versions of BeanUtils delegated all conversion to String to the registered
String Converter. All Converter implementations provided by BeanUtils can now handle
conversion to String (as well as from) for their type. New ConvertUtils lookup/convert
methods have been added which delegate conversion to String appropriately. However
existing convert methods work as before to retain compatibility, but can be switched
to the new behaviour by configuring the BeanUtilsBean2 / ConvertUtilsBean2 implementations.


Errors
------
Exception messages have been improved, providing more information relating to
where the failure occured. For JDK 1.4+ where BeanUtils catches exceptions
and throws new ones - the cause is now being intialized.

The following is a list of the enhancements in this release, with their Jira issue number:

  * [BEANUTILS-259] - Plugable Property Name Expression Resolver

  * [BEANUTILS-274] - BeanUtils cannot set property of type Long with value of Double
  * [BEANUTILS-168] - BeanUtils's copyProperties(List, List) does not work - add warning about this
  * [BEANUTILS-17]  - BeanUtils's copyProperties - IllegalArgumentException when property types don't match
  * [BEANUTILS-199] - BeanUtils's setProperty is over-zealous at converting types
  * [BEANUTILS-68]  - BeanUtils's setProperty - mapped property requires a setter for a map, but never uses it

                      (fixed by changes to MappedPropertyDescriptor associated with BEANUTILS-6)
  * [BEANUTILS-33]  - PropertyUtils incosistency - can't use "dot" in mapped properties for setProperty or getPropertyDescriptor
                      (fixed by the changes for BEANUTILS-259 Plugable Property Name Expression Resolver).

  * [BEANUTILS-262] - Correct getPropertyDescriptor() and setNestedProperty() methods to throw a NestedNullException rather
