/**
 * <p>Decorates a {@link DynaBean} to provide {@code Map} behavior.</p>
 *
 * <p>The motivation for this implementation is to provide access to {@link DynaBean}
 *    properties in technologies that are unaware of BeanUtils and {@link DynaBean}s -
 *    such as the expression languages of JSTL and JSF.</p>
 *
 * <p>This can be achieved either by wrapping the {@link DynaBean} prior to
 *    providing it to the technolody to process or by providing a {@code Map}
 *    accessor method on the DynaBean implementation:
 * </p>
 *    <pre>
 *         public Map getMap() {
 *             return new DynaBeanMapDecorator(this);
 *         }</pre>
 *
 * <p>This, for example, could be used in JSTL in the following way to access
 *    a DynaBean's {@code fooProperty}:
 * </p>
 *    {@code ${myDynaBean.<strong>map</strong>.fooProperty}}
 *
 * <strong>Usage</strong>
 *
 * <p>To decorate a {@link DynaBean} simply instantiate this class with the
 *    target {@link DynaBean}:</p>
 *
 * {@code Map fooMap = new DynaBeanMapDecorator(fooDynaBean);}
 *
 * <p>The above example creates a <strong><em>read only</em></strong> {@code Map}.
 *    To create  a {@code Map} which can be modified, construct a
 *    {@code DynaBeanMapDecorator} with the <strong><em>read only</em></strong>
 *    attribute set to {@code false}:</p>
 *
 * {@code Map fooMap = new DynaBeanMapDecorator(fooDynaBean, false);}
 *
 * <strong>Limitations</strong>
 * <p>In this implementation the {@code entrySet()}, {@code keySet()}
 *    and {@code values()} methods create an <strong><em>unmodifiable</em></strong>
 *    {@code Set} and it does not support the Map's {@code clear()}
 *    and {@code remove()} operations.</p>
 * <p>For reasons of backwards compatibility, the generic types of this
 *    {@code Map} implementation are {@code <Object, Object>}. However, the
 *    keys of the map are typically strings.</p>
 *
 * @since BeanUtils 1.8.0
 * @deprecated Use {@link DynaBeanPropertyMapDecorator} instead. When adding
 * generics it turned out that it was not possible to use the correct type
 * parameters without breaking backwards compatibility. Therefore, class
 * {@code DynaBeanPropertyMapDecorator} was introduced as a replacement.
