/**
 * A special classloader useful for testing j2ee-like scenarios.
 *
 * <p>In some tests we want to be able to emulate "container" frameworks,
 * where code runs in a hierarchy of classloaders, and certain classes may
 * be loaded by various classloaders in the hierarchy.</p>
 *
 * <p>Normally this is done by having certain jars or class-file-directories
 * in the classpath of some classloaders but not others. This is quite
 * difficult difficult to integrate with the build process for the unit
 * tests though; compiling certain classes and having the output go into
 * places that is not in the default classpath for the unit tests would be
 * a major pain.</p>
 *
 * <p>So this class takes a sneaky alternative approach: it can grab any class
 * already loaded by a parent classloader and <i>reload</i> that class via this
 * classloader. The effect is exactly as if a class (or jar file) had been
 * present in the classpath for a container's "shared" classloader <i>and</i>
 * been present in the component-specific classpath too, without any messing
 * about with the way unit test code is compiled or executed.
